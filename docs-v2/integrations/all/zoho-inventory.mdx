## Connection configuration in Nango

Zoho uses [different domain extensions](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v3/multi-dc.html) for different regions. 

You need to pass the domain extension to use to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('zoho-inventory', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {extension: 'com'}});
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/advanced-auth#connection-configuration).

## API gotchas
- You can make your OAuth app cross-data-centers with [these instructions](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v3/multi-dc.html). This means that a single OAuth app will be able to query the Zoho API for Zoho accounts from the US, EU, etc.
