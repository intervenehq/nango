## API gotchas

- Klaviyo uses Public API Key and Private API Key to access different endpoints.
- Endpoints that begin with `/api` need to be authenticated with private API key in the header.
- Endpoints that begin with `/client` need to be authenticatd with public API key in the query.
- All API calls must have _revision_ as a header to resolve API versions.
