## Update _connection metadata_

Use this API endpoint to update your [custom metadata](/guides/advanced-auth#storing-custom-metadata-per-connection) for a _connection_.

Nango uses the request body as the new metadata (it must be a JSON object). This will take in whatever metadata and merge it with any
existing metadata.

## Fetching _connection metadata_

To read the existing metadata of a _connection_, simply [fetch it](/api-reference/connection/get). Your custom metadata is included as part of the returned _connection_ object.
